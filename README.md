## ðŸ§  Philosophy

DirectiveOS rejects dopamine-chasing feature bloat. Instead, itâ€™s engineered around:

- **Modular implementation** â€” snap-in tools, zero excess.
- **Durable systems** â€” routines and workflows that scale with you.
- **Self-hosted control** â€” local-first design, no dependency lock-in.
- **Unified interface** â€” tasks, journals, schedules, and signals in one pane.
