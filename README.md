DirectiveOS is a modular, self-hostable system for executive function, task automation, and mental load management. Inspired by the need for durable structure over chaotic hustle, DirectiveOS integrates scheduling, journaling, prioritization, and adaptive workflows into a single unified platform.

- 🧠 Built for clarity under pressure
- ⚙️ Designed for long-term sustainability
- 🧩 Modular by default: plug in what you need
- 🔐 Self-hosted, privacy-respecting by design

DirectiveOS is not another productivity hack. It’s an operating system for human function.
